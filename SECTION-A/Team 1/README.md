Major Project on Prediction of Alzheimerâ€™s Disease using Supervised Learning Algorithms

Description: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurological condition that leads to short-term memory loss, paranoia, and delusional ideas that are mistaken for the effects of stress or aging.
Prediction of Alzheimer's disease using Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) data and techniques such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and deep learning model are employed to identify best parameters and performance is measured with parameters like Precision, Recall, Accuracy, and F1-score for ML model.
