Automatic gait measurement and analysis is an enabling tool for intelligent healthcare and robotics-assisted rehabilitation. A support vector machine-based classifier is developed to classify four types of gait patterns with different neuro diseases. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of ensemble techniques in improving the analysis of gait patterns and provide valuable insights for the diagnosis and management of neuro diseases.
