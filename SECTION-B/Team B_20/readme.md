The diagnosis of early stage lung cancer is challenging due to its asymptomatic nature. Examining the lung CT images to detect pulmonary nodules, especially the cell lung cancer lesions, is also tedious and prone to errors even by a specialist. 
The traditional methods of classifying the lung CT images are not so accurate and can easily miss lead in the early stages. Mutation, unregulated tissue growth, refers to the occurrence of permanent changes in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequences.
Mutation can be due to external factors or inherited genetic abnormalities. The most common external factors are chemicals in tobacco smoke but numerous other carcinogens exist. Earlier we classify and predict the lung nodules, more chances to recover from lung cancer. A better approach to classify the CT images is using deep learning.
