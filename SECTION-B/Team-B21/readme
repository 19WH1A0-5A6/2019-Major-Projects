Leukocytes, produced in the bone marrow, make up around one percent of all blood cells. Uncontrolled growth of these white blood cells leads to the birth of blood cancer Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer where the bone marrow forms too many lymphocytes. On the other hand, Multiple myeloma (MM), a different kind of cancer, causes cancer cells to accumulate in the bone marrow rather than releasing them into the bloodstream. Our project is to predict where the cells are cancerous or normal using the neural networks.
